# Scientific-Calculator-Design-Patterns-
This is a Python-based Scientific Calculator implementing Command, Strategy, and Decorator design patterns. It supports both basic arithmetic and advanced scientific operations (e.g., logarithmic, trigonometric, and polynomial root calculations). The structure is modular, extensible, and designed for maintainability and clarity.


Features
✅ Basic Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

✅ Scientific Functions: Logarithm, Sine, Cosine

✅ Polynomial Solver: Solves quadratic equations using the Strategy pattern

✅ Design Pattern Integration:

Command Pattern: Encapsulates operations as objects for reusability

Strategy Pattern: Switch between arithmetic and polynomial logic at runtime

Decorator Pattern: Layer functions like Log, Sin, Cos dynamically on results

✅ Clean OOP structure with extensibility in mind
